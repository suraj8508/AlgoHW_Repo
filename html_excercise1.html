                Alleppey, which is also called as Alappuzha, is a coastal district of Kerala. Alleppey become famous for many reasons like the beautiful combination of lakes, lagoons, crisscrossed narrow canals, rivers, coconut palms, paddy fields and many more.
                Earlier Alleppey and near by areas are low laying wet lands. These wet lands are part of Vembanadu lake which originates from Astamudi Lake at Quilon till Kochi. The Maharaja of erstwhile Travancore state has given permission to reclaim these wetlands and converted these wetlands to fertile paddy fields due to increasing needs of rice for local people. Reclamation of wetland system started in 1832 and by the end of 1984 approx 2300 hectors of land has been reclaimed. Two thirds of the total vembanadu lake has been reclaimed or converted in to paddy fields. When this vast lake reclaimed and converted to paddy fields, many big and small canals and rivers are formed. More than half of this area is now known as Kuttanad, which has vast paddy fields, lagoons, small canals and rivers. Most of the small and narrow canals are located in Kuttanad.
                Alleppey, being a coastal district one side of Alleppey is beautiful canals and rivers and other side is the Arabian Sea which is Alleppey beach.
