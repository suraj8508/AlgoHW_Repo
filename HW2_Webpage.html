        <ol>
            <li>Grind garlic, ginger, and green chilies to a smooth paste. Add little water to make the process easier.</li>
            <li>Marinate chicken using half of the paste, ground turmeric, 1 tsp ground red chilies, 1/2 tsp garam masala, and salt. </li>
            <li>Keep it in the refrigerator for an hour. Then shallow fry the pieces in oil. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Soak 7 cashew nuts in 1/2 cup of water. Set aside for half an hour. Then grind the nuts to a smooth paste. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Soak basmati rice in water for half an hour and set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat some oil in another pan and fry 1/4 cup of sliced onions, 13 cashew nuts, and raisins separately. Set aside.</li>
            <li>To prepare rice for the biriyani:-<h5>Heat 2 tbsp ghee in a deep pan and splutter fennel seeds. Fry one medium onion until translucent. Add cloves, cardamom pods, cinnamon sticks, and bay leaves. Fry again. Add 8 cups of water along with 3 cups of washed rice. Add lemon juice. Season with salt. Let it come to a boil. Then turn down the heat and cover the pan with a lid. Once cooked, drain and keep it aside.</h5></li>
            <li>To prepare gravy for chicken:- <h5>Heat oil in a pan and fry the rest of the onions until golden brown. Then add the remaining paste and fry for a few seconds. Throw in tomatoes, the rest of the spices ( ground coriander, ground red chilies, ground black pepper, garam masala), and enough salt and cashew nut paste. Fry again for 3-4 minutes. Add chicken pieces along with 1/3 cup of water. Finally, add 2 tsp yogurt and 1 tsp vinegar. Cook again for a couple of minutes.</h5></li>
            <li>To arrange the layers:-<h5>Take a deep heavy bottomed pan and place a layer of chicken. Then add a layer of rice. Pour 1/2 tsp rose water. Use chicken and rice alternatively until finished. But make sure the top layer is rice. Pour 1/2 tsp rose water. Add 1 tbsp ghee.</h5></li>
            <li>Now you can garnish biryani with fried cashew nuts, raisins, onions, and chopped coriander leaves.</li>

    <h4>Tips:-</h4>
    <h5>
        <ul>
            <li>The first and foremost important thing to take care of while preparing chicken biryani recipe is, always use a heavy-bottomed pan as you would not want the chicken getting cooked.</li>
            <li>The restaurant-style chicken biryani recipe uses the whole chicken in preparation and the chicken breast can dry when cooking at home. It's always suggested to use chicken thigh </li>
            <li>If you want your chicken to be juicier in your biryani, do not remove the bone.</li>
            <li>If your cooked rice has turned sticky, spread it on a plate and leave it for 5 minutes. The rice will be separate and fluffy again.</li>
            <li>Freshly pound spices bring out the best taste in Chicken Biryani Recipe, so make sure that you dry roast all the whole spices for a good 2-3 minutes and then pound or grind them.</li>
        </ul>
